        <h1> Who am I ?</h1>
        <p>As a kid my parents would spend hours reading to me about fairy tales and wonder worlds.
         I have always wished to one day emerge myself in such a world (or better yet live in one), but as of yet this is not possible.
         So it came to be that my love for fantasy sparked my creativity and I wanted to be able to put my ideas to paper and visualize the worlds and people I saw in my head. At some point in primary school I started to game which was the first time I could emerge myself into a whole diferent world.

         I knew than that I wanted to stay connected to these worlds and places, that on my screen were real.
         The combination of the two was concept art, being able to draw and work on fantasy worlds or places not yet created.
         Around this time I became interested in photography as well as building other "worlds"  namely websites and so I delved into HTML and CSS.
         Overall I am a young visual artist with a drive to be a coder and once again combine them to become a front end developer !      </p>
